# Glove-Based-ASL-translator
This repository entails the code of a Glove based Sign Language Translator System that is capable of translating hand gestures that entail the American Sign Language(ASL) to their corresponding meanings in order to enable the hearing-impaired and the mute community to make conversations or seek help in case of emergencies effectively. This project is an Arduino based construction that interfaces three different types of sensor elements in order to process the hand gestures and the individual digit (finger) orientations to suit the alphabet wise indication. This circuitry works in tandem with a Bluetooth module that relays the translation to the userâ€™s smartphone, engaging mobility and a hassle free interface that only requires the person on the other end to have a reading ability. This project can further be enhanced by introducing phrases that are commonly used in the ASL and by attempting to make a more compact circuit. The outcome of this project is indicative of the scope for further research in terms of design excellency and innovation specific to public and market needs.
